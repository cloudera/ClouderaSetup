== Summary 
This document provides an overview of the deployment of *Cloudera Private Cloud Base* and its integrated *Data Services* on *Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization (OCP Virt)*. 

Full details of the architecture, technical stack, testing procedures, and security implementations are covered in the following guides:

* link:OCP_Virt_Setup_for_Cloudera_onprem.pdf[**OCP Virt Setup for Cloudera On-Prem**]

* link:Cloudera_On-Premise_Deployment_Guide-OCP-Virt.pdf[**Cloudera On-Premise Deployment Guide**]

== Why This Matters

This converged architecture solves a ton of headaches:

* *Unified Platform* 
Running both traditional VMs (for Cloudera Base) and containers on a single Kubernetes platform.
* *Massive Scale Validation* 
Testing confirmed robustness at scale, integrating a *100+ OCP-Virtualized node* Cloudera Base Cluster with a dedicated Data Services Cluster (7 bare metal nodes).

== The Technical Stack at a Glance

Red Hat and Cloudera components:

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|*Component* |*Key Version* |*Role*
|*OpenShift Container Platform* |4.19.15 |Virtualization
|*RHEL* |9.5 |Operating system
|*Cloudera Manager* |7.13.1 CHF4+ |Centralized cluster management
|*CDH Parcel* |7.3.1.400 SP2 |Cloudera's core data runtime
|*Cloudera Private Cloud DS* |1.5.5 |Platform for Data Services
|===

== Data Services Testing At Scale

End to End Functionality was validated across the major Data Services:

* *CDW (Cloudera Data Warehouse)* : Created Virtual Warehouses (Hive / Impala) and ran successful sample CRUD queries via the Hue interface.
* *CDE (Cloudera Data Engineering)* : Set up Virtual Clusters (Spark 3.5.1), added Hadoop Authentication with a Keytab, and executed multiple sample Spark jobs.
* *CAI (Cloudera AI)* : Successfully deployed the AI Workbench, configured Hadoop Authentication, and tested session creation with sample project templates.

== Enterprise Security

Implemented a full security suite, ensuring the cluster meets enterprise compliance and operational needs:

* *Identity & Access* : Leveraged *FreeIPA* (v4.12.2) as the Identity Provider for Kerberos and LDAP, securing principals and simplifying user management.
* *Data Protection* : Used Ranger for granular access control and AutoTLS (Self-signed) for encryption in transit.
* *Gateways* : Knox and Atlas were configured, with access secured either directly or via the Knox SSO gateway.

== Real-World Proof: The Use Case

Executed a Bank Branch Performance Analytics workload to exercise the full data lifecycle — ingestion, processing, and serving. This involved:

. Ingesting data into *HDFS/Ozone*.
. Processing and transforming the data using *CDE Spark jobs*.
. Querying and reporting from data materialized in *CDW (Hive/Impala)*.
. Visualizing the final metrics with a data visualization app.
